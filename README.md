# JPG-Converter
Python program that converts images into JPG form

This project is a simple but useful program that can convert any image type to JPEG format. The idea behind this project came from my coworkers who were struggling with manually converting images to JPEG format for uploading job site photos, which is ourcompany's standard. I saw an opportunity to use my Python skills to save time and effort for my colleagues.
